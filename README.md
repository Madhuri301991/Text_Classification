# Text_Classification

Text_Classification:
- read movie_review. 
- Transform text into numerical vector data using a pipeline.
- Build pipeline of TfidfVectorizer and classifier to vectorize the data, then train and fit a model. 
- Use LinearSVC, naive bayes classifier to classify the reviews of positive and negative.
- LinearSVC provides better accuracy than naive bayes classifier. 
- Test the classifier on new data. Evaluate performance. 

- --> Text classification - classification of movies reviews into positive and negative labels. Here the dataset already contains the label column.
- --> Sentiment analysis - classify movies reviews into positive and negative label where the dataset doesnt have pre-label. It is done using NLTK package and applied directly to unlabeled text data.
